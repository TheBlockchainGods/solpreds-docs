The presale interface will require this before allowing you to contribute.</p> <p>??? question \"Can I change my Solana delivery address?\"     If you contribute from different chains with different Solana addresses, tokens will be sent to each address separately. Make sure to use the same Solana address for all contributions if you want them in one wallet.</p> <p>??? question \"How is the token price determined?\"     The token price is determined by the total amount raised divided by the tokens allocated to presale (300,000,000 tokens = 30% of supply).</p> <pre><code>Example: If $3,000,000 is raised, price = $3M / 300M tokens = $0.01 per token\n</code></pre> <p>??? question \"When will tokens be tradeable?\"     Tokens will be tradeable immediately after TGE when liquidity is added to decentralized exchanges (Jupiter/Raydium on Solana).</p> <p>??? question \"Is the team allocation vested?\"     Yes, the 30% team allocation is vested to prevent dumping and ensure long-term commitment to the project.</p> <p>??? question \"What will the listing price be?\"     The listing price will be set after the presale ends based on the total raised and market conditions. It will be announced before TGE.</p>"},{"location":"presale/#security-trust","title":"Security &amp; Trust","text":"<ul> <li>\u2705 Multi-chain contribution tracking verified</li> <li>\u2705 Maximum limits enforced across all chains</li> <li>\u2705 Transparent token distribution</li> <li>\u2705 Team tokens vested for long-term alignment</li> <li>\u2705 25% allocated to liquidity at launch</li> </ul>"},{"location":"presale/#need-help","title":"Need Help?","text":"<ul> <li>\ud83d\udce7 Email: theblockchaingods@gmail.com</li> <li>\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: @solpreds</li> <li>\ud83d\udcac Telegram: Join our community</li> <li>\ud83d\udcac Discord: Join our community</li> </ul> <p>Start Contributing Now \u2192</p>"},{"location":"developers/api-reference/","title":"SOLPREDS API Reference","text":"<p>Base URL: <code>https://solpreds.fun/api/bot</code></p> <p>Last Updated: February 2026 (Mainnet Optimization)</p>"},{"location":"developers/api-reference/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The SOLPREDS Bot API provides endpoints for programmatic betting on Solana price predictions. </p> <p>Important: This API prepares transaction data for your bot to sign and submit.
