## FAQs

??? question "When will I receive my tokens?"
    Tokens will be distributed at TGE (Token Generation Event) to:
    
    - The Solana address you entered (if you used BNB Chain or Base)
    - The Solana address you contributed from (if you used Solana)

??? question "Can I contribute from multiple chains?"
    Yes! You can contribute from all three chains. Your total will be tracked across all chains and distributed to the Solana address you input or have connected.
    
    However, your maximum total across ALL chains is $3,000 USDC.

??? question "What's the minimum contribution?"
    Minimum contribution is $10 USDC on any chain.

??? question "Is there a maximum?"
    Maximum contribution per wallet is $3,000 USDC total across all chains.

??? question "What if I forget to enter my Solana address?"
    You MUST enter a valid Solana address before contributing on BNB Chain or Base. The presale interface will require this before allowing you to contribute.

??? question "Can I change my Solana delivery address?"
    If you contribute from different chains with different Solana addresses, tokens will be sent to each address separately. Make sure to use the same Solana address for all contributions if you want them in one wallet.

??? question "How is the token price determined?"
    The token price is determined by the total amount raised divided by the tokens allocated to presale (300,000,000 tokens = 30% of supply).
    
    Example: If $3,000,000 is raised, price = $3M / 300M tokens = $0.01 per token

??? question "When will tokens be tradeable?"
    Tokens will be tradeable immediately after TGE when liquidity is added to decentralized exchanges (Jupiter/Raydium on Solana).

??? question "Is the team allocation vested?"
    Yes, the 30% team allocation is vested to prevent dumping and ensure long-term commitment to the project.

??? question "What will the listing price be?"
    The listing price will be set after the presale ends based on the total raised and market conditions. It will be announced before TGE.
